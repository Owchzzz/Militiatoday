<section id="admin_panel">

<h1>
	Setting up the channel broadcasts</h1>
<p>
	The RealTV admin panel is quite simple to use. If it&#39;s your first time, after login, you should see three metro-styled boxes. The first one contains the broadcast schedule data, the second is just a channel selector and the third one is a form to add a new channel.</p>
<h2>
	Make A New Channel</h2>
<p>
	To add a shiny new channel, you&#39;ve got to fill the form in the third box. Choose a title for your channel (no special characters), a starting time (24h format) and days of the week. Select all days, if you want your channel to play everyday. Press the big &quot;+&quot; button at the end.</p>
    <img src="img5.png" alt="img5" />
<p class="warning">
	The channel title MUST BE unique! This will be the ID you&#39;ll use to call your new webtv player into your front end webpage. It's required in order to call any RealTV instance. See the Setup section for details.</p>
<p>
	You will notice a new channel appeared in the central box. Click on it, to load it&#39;s data in the first box.</p>
<h2>
	Select a channel to edit</h2>
<p>
	Just click on the channel&#39;s title in the central box, and the data will be loaded in the first box.</p>
</section>
<section id="addvideos"><h2>
	Manage channel videos</h2>
<p>
	After data is loaded on the first box, you should see a list of channel videos. If the channel is new or empty, you should see only a little &quot;+&quot; button in the first box. Clicking on it will show an input field. Insert any YouTube video link on it and save. Data of that video will be shown.</p>
<p>
	Any video entry in the channel has four buttons to the right. The first &quot;x&quot; button deletes the video entry. Right under, the edit button give you the option to change the video. Arrow buttons changes video position, relative to other videos.</p>
    <img src="img4.png" alt="img4" />

<p>To add a new video, just click on any &quot;+&quot; little button. The video will be added in that position.</p>
<p>Note: You will need to paste the YouTube URL into the channel without using mouse right-click. On your Windows computer press the CTRL button and the "v" key.</p>

        <img src="img3.png" alt="img3" />
<h3>
	Loop</h3>
<p>
	The &quot;loop&quot; options overrides the days selected. The channel simply will play in loop. Just for curiosity, the virtual starting time, in this case, is the Epoch.</p>
<h3>
	Show controls</h3> 
<p>
	If selected, video controls such as volume, play and pause will be shown.
    </p>
<h3>
	Player size</h3>
<p>
	Here you can modify the size of the video player, to fit your needs.</p>
<h3>
	Channel Offline Notification</h3>
<p>
	When there is nothing to broadcast, RealTV will output this message instead of video stream. You can customize it here.</p>
<p class="warning">
	If you change the title of a channel already included in your webpage, REMEMBER to modify also the php callings inside your webpage accordingly! TIP: never modify a channel title.</p>
    <h3> Shift from server Timezone</h3>
    <p>If your server is located in a place with different timezone, you can specify the shift from that timezone and your local time, so you can set all channels in local time.
<h2>
	Import playlists</h2>
<p>
